## What is Markdown?

Colab has two types of cells: text and code. Text cells are formatted using a simple markup language called Markdown.


To see the Markdown source, double-click a text cell, showing both the Markdown source and the rendered version. Above the Markdown source there is a toolbar to assist editing.

## Reference

Headings are rendered as titles.

```markdown
# Section 1
# Section 2
## Sub-section under Section 2
### Sub-section under the sub-section under Section 2
# Section 3
```

# Section 1
# Section 2

The table of contents, available on the left side of Colab, is populated using at most one section title from each text cell.
