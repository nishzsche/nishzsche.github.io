# Sorting Algorithms Visualizer
## Objective
* Create a visual tool that demonstrates the functioning of various sorting algorithms, such as Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort.
* The visualizer should allow users to observe how each algorithm sorts a list of numbers step-by-step, illustrating the time complexity differences between algorithms.

## Key Learning Goals

* Understanding Time Complexity: See how different algorithms perform based on their time complexity.
* Algorithm Behavior: Learn the inner workings of each sorting algorithm, including how they handle data, swaps, and comparisons.
* Visualization Skills: Develop skills in data visualization, particularly in illustrating dynamic processes like sorting.
